<h2 id="int">Introduction</h2>
There are some `inherent difficulties` in applying RL to solve practical robotic challenges. Our review aims to `provide our perceived picture` of using RL in the context of robot manipulation. We try to cover background knowledge, interesting research results, open problems, and provide our insights into future directions. <br>
We decided to conduct the review starting in 2013. we start in section ‚Ö° by describing key RL concepts and terminology. Section ‚Ö¢ continues with a taxonomy of RL algorithms followed by section ‚Ö£ with a focus on the context of robot manipulation. We describe our perspectives about future directions in section ‚Ö§ and section ‚Ö• concludes the review.

<h2 id="bac">Background</h2>
üí° [KEY CONCEPTS AND TERMINOLOGY] <br><br>
![Fig. 1](images/2022-09-14.PNG) <center>Fig 1: The agent-environment interaction</center> <br>
There are four main elements of a RL system: <br>
a policy, a reward signal, a value function, and optionally a model of the environment.
- policy: defines the learning agent's way of behaving at a given time. mapping from the perceived states to actions to be taken when being in those states.
- reward signal: a reward is dependent on the current state and the action $r=R(s,a)$. the agent's ultimate goal is to maximize the cumulative reward  $G_t=R_{t+1} + \gamma*R_(t+2)+\gamma^2*R_(t+3)+\cdots$ (discount rate $\gamma\in[0 1]$)
- model of the environment: allows inferences about how the environment will behave. the dynamics of the environment is fully characterized by a distribution $p$. <br><br>

Markov Decision Process(MDP) is a classical formalization of sequential decision making. <br>
It contains:
- a set of possible states $\mathcal{S}$
- a set of possible actions $\mathcal{A}$
- a reward function $R(s,a)\in\mathcal{R}$
- a probability distribution $p(s',r\|s,a)$ of the environment <br><br>

A value function specifies what is good in the long run of a state $s$ or a state-action pair $(s,a)$ when following a particular policy $\pi$.
- value function $V^\pi(s)=E_{a\~\pi}[R(\tau)\|s_t=s]$
- action-value function $Q^\pi(s,a)=E_{a\~\pi}[R(\tau)\|s_t=s, a_t=a]$
- optimal value function $\~$
- optimal action-value function 

Given the optimal $Q^{*}(s,a)$, we can obtain the optimal action $a^(*)(s)=arg max_a Q^(*)(s,a)$ at a given state $s$, and then we can directly construct the optimal policy $\phi^{*}$. <br>

Bellman equation is obeyed by all four types of value functions.
- $V^\pi(s)=E[G_t\|s_t=s]$$=E[r_t+\gamma*G_{t+1}\|s_t=s]=E[r_t+\gamma*E[G_{t+1}\|s_t=s]\|s_t=s]=E[r_t+\gamma*V^\pi(s_{t+1})\|s_t=s]$
- $G^\pi(s,a)=E[G_t\|s_t=s, a_t=a]=E[r_t+\gamma*G_{t+1}\|s_t=s, a_t=a]=E[r_t+\gamma*E[G_{t+1}\|s_t=s, a_t=a]\|s_t=s, a_t=a]$
- $V^\ast(s)=E[G_t\|s_t=s]=E[r_t+\gamma*G_{t+1}\|s_t=s]=E[r_t+\gamma*E[G_{t+1}\|s_t=s]\|s_t=s]=E[r_t+\gamma*V^\ast(s_{t+1})\|s_t=s]$
- $Q^\ast(s,a)=E[G_t\|s_t=s, a_t=a]=E[r_t+\gamma*G_{t+1}\|s_t=s, a_t=a]=E[r_t+\gamma*E[G_{t+1}\|s_t=s, a_t=a]\|s_t=s, a_t=a]=E[r_t+\gamma*Q^\ast(s_{t+1},a_{t+1})\|s_t=s, a_t=a]=E[r_t+\gamma*max_{a_{t+1}}Q^\ast(s_{t+1},a_{t+1})\|s_t=s, a_t=a]$

üí° [TAXONOMY OF RL ALGORITHMS] <br>
A. Model-based amd Model-free <br>
- whether the agent has the access or learns a model of the environment.
- Model-based: having a model that allows the agent to plan ahead to predict what would happen when choosing a certain action from a range of possible ones.
- Model-free: it is usually the case when the model is not available or the learning of such a model is very challenging. figure out the value functions directly from the interactions with the environment. rely heavily on reward signals for learning the value functions, so it is important to have learning-induced reward functions. it is often easier to implement and tune hyperparameters. <br><br>

B. Value-based and Policy-based <br>
- Value-based: try to estimate the action-value function $Q(s,a\|\theta)$ for the optimal $Q^\ast(s,a)$. this optimization is often performed off-policy, meaning that the policy used to generate behavior for getting training data, may be unrelated to the policy that is evaluated and improved, called the estimation policy.
- Policy-based: parameterize the policy as $\pi(s,a\|\theta)$, and the target is to optimize $\theta$ either through gradient descent on an objective function $J(\pi)$ or by maximizing local approximations of $J$. this method is often on-policy, meaning that they estimate the value of a policy while using it for control. it is less sample-efficient as they only use samples collected from the latest version of the policy. we directly optimize what we need, which allows stability and reliability improvements.
<br><br>

<h2 id="app">Approach</h2>
Robotics RL is often modeled as `partially observable MDP` as it is common for states to be unobservable or partially observable. Successful algorithms especially model-based methods, therefore, need to be `robust to a significant scale of uncertainty` in the model. we discuss three main issues, from our perspective, limiting the application of RL for real-world robotics problems. <br><br>

üí° [sample inefficiency] <br>
There are multiple causes for the problem.
1. many algorithms try to learn to perform a task from `scratch`, therefore, they would need a lot of data to learn.
2. algorithms are still `not good enough at exploiting` useful information from current data.
3. data collection in robotics is often very `time-consuming`.

Evolution algorithms[^1] are the least sample-efficient as they do not use gradient for optimization, but they might have comparable performance. Policy gradient methods are next in terms of sample efficiency, followed by methods that use replay buffer to estimate Q-values. Model-based algorithms are taking the lead in terms of data efficiency as they try to derive a model of the environment and use that model for training the policy instead of data from real interactions. Guided Policy Search[^2] is very data-efficient as it used trajectory optimization to direct policy learning and avoid poor local optima. The current winner is model-based "shallow" algorithm[^3]. <br>

In order to be more data-efficient, we need to `collect more data` and use the data more efficiently. One way to have more data is `using multiple robots` to collect data simultaneously. Real data can also be augmented with `synthetic data`, possibly from simulators. In this approach, the `gap` between synthetic data and real robot data `needs to be reduced`. We can use deep learning architecture[^4], progressive networks[^5], and so on[^6]. In robotics, data is `specific to certain robots and configurations`. It will be very useful if we have a mechanism to `transform data` so that it can be widely distributed and used in multiple platforms and configurations. Finally, we will need `novel algorithms` that can use data more `efficiently`. `Model-based` approach might be one of the most potential ways to unlock sample efficiency.
<br><br><br>

üí° [exploration and exploitation]
- exploration: give more knowledge about the environment, which can lead to better future decisions.
- exploitation: choose the best action to take given the current information.

A balance between exploration and exploitation is required. Using $\epsilon$-greedy to balance exploration and exploitation, the agent will either take random action at the probability $\epsilon$ or follow the action that maximized the Q-value with the probability $1-\epsilon$. Vanilla policy gradient method[^7], Trust Region Policy Optimization(TPRO)[^8], and Proximal Policy Optimization(PPO)[^9] explore by sampling actions according to the latest version of its stochastic policy. DDPG[^10] trains a deterministic policy in an off-policy way with noise being added to the action at training time. Soft Actor-Critic(SAC)[^11] explores with entropy regularization. <br>

$\epsilon$-greedy is one of the most commonly used methods for exploration, but it `treats all actions equivalently`. So, it is unguided, too naive[^12], and does not explore areas with promising actions.
For `on-policy` algorithms, the scale of randomness is reduced due to the updated policy rule favoring more exploitation during training. As a result, the policy might be `trapped in local optima`.
For `deterministic policies`, `noise` is added to their actions during training time, and the scale of noise might be reduced to get more high-quality training time. This approach will become `insufficient` when facing `sparse and deceptive reward` problem.
We also `lack a useful benchmark` that can be used to evaluate the performance of different approaches for exploration. Also, the `performance` of exploration strategies `vary among environments and configurations`, making it hard to quantify the true improvement.
And, exploration which is facing uncertainty is very `unsafe for fragile robots`.
<br><br><br>

üí° [generalization and reproducibility] <br>
There are two main directions to investigating the generalization[^13]. The first approach is similar to robust control[^14] in control theory when policies are designed so that they can still function with environment variations by scarifying performance in other environments. The second approach is similar to adaptive control[^15], trying to adapt to the current environment.
Regarding reproducibility[^16], Network structure is one of the factors that can significantly impact performance. Random seed is another factor having a large effect on performance. To improve robustness, some research tried to close the control loop with visual feedback[^17], or optimize hyperparameters using genetic algorithms[^18]. <br>

We currently do `not have an effective benchmark` to evaluate the generalization. For a testbed for measuring generalization, we need to clearly define a set of tasks, comparison metrics, and baselines so that we can quantify fairly.
Combating reproducibility is challenging for the continuous environment such as in robots due to a `higher instability`. Besides the need for more robust RL algorithms to hyperparameters, we would possibly need to agree on proper experimental methodologies and proper evaluation methods and metrics to address the problem. Effective tools for documenting changes during experiment setup and `standard set of environments` are also useful for improving reproducibility.
<br><br>

<h2 id="res">Results and Discussion</h2>
The strongest motivation for future developments is how to efficiently take deep RL algorithms to the real world. From our perspective, agents/robots must learn `much faster and more efficiently`. <br>
`Model-based learning` has the biggest advantage of being sample-efficient and there existed interesting research in this direction to predict the future. <br>
There is still a `big gap between RL algorithms and humans` in terms of sample efficiency. We do not learn from scratch, and we can reuse our past knowledge to learn a new skill much more efficiently. Model-based learning approach can also help in this situation, thanks to its more potential transferability and generality. A different approach rather than approximating the dynamics is to use `multi-task learning` to reuse skills. The interesting thing in this work was learning on various tasks had better performance compared to learning in a single-task setting. <br>
Transfer learning[^19] tries to use experience from one set of tasks for faster learning and better performance on a new task. Transfer learning from tasks trained on simulators is particularly tempting as relatively cheap resources are needed. Another study performed `parallel learning` between simulated and real robots by introducing `additional alignment rewards` that encourage both agents in two domains to have similar distributions over visited states. <br>
`Inverse RL` is also promising, which can solve the nightmare of designing reasonable reward functions.
<br><br>
